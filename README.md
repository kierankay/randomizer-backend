# Randomizer

Randomizer is a JavaScript / Node / Postgres app for randomizing pairs of students in a classroom. It ensures an even distribution of partners to maximize students' opportunities to learn from partners. Setting the max number of pairs ago that a pair could have happened ago enables selecting the degree of randomness optimizing between maximizing past-pair distances (resulting in predictable round-robin style pairing) and total randomness (resulting in some potential repeat pairs).
